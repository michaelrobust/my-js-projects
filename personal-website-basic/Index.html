            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Michael, a computer science student with a passion for web development and artificial intelligence. I grew up in San Francisco, where I developed my love for technology by tinkering with computers and learning programming languages in my spare time.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring the city's diverse neighborhoods, trying new restaurants, and hiking in the nearby mountains. I believe that technology should be used to solve real-world problems and make people's lives better, which is why I'm particularly interested in developing accessible and user-friendly applications.</p>
