            <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p>My favorite class was CS-546 Web Programming, where I learned how to build full-stack web applications using modern technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.</p>
            <aside>I'll never forget the time during finals week when I spent 12 hours straight debugging a single line of code, only to realize I had forgotten a semicolon. It taught me the importance of taking breaks and having fresh eyes look at problems.</aside>

            <h2>Lincoln High School</h2>
            <p>My favorite class was AP Computer Science, which introduced me to programming for the first time and sparked my passion for software development.</p>
            <aside>During my junior year, I organized a coding club that grew from 5 members to over 30 students. We built a mobile app for the school cafeteria menu that the administration actually implemented, which made me realize the real-world impact programming could have.</aside>

            <h2>Roosevelt Middle School</h2>
            <p>My favorite class was Mathematics, where I discovered my love for logical problem-solving and analytical thinking that later helped me in programming.</p>
            <aside>I remember being selected to represent our school in the district math competition. Even though I didn't win, the experience of working under pressure and presenting my solutions to judges gave me confidence that I still carry today.</aside>

            <h2>Washington Elementary School</h2>
            <p>My favorite class was Library Science, where I learned research skills and discovered my love for learning new things independently.</p>
            <aside>Mrs. Johnson, our librarian, let me help organize the computer lab and taught me basic typing skills. I was so excited to use the computers that I would volunteer to stay after school just to practice typing games and explore educational software.</aside>
