    <h1>My Story</h1>
    
    <main>
        <p>It all started in my senior year computer science class. Mr. Wang announced a final project requiring us to work in groups of four to conduct in-depth research on "How Technology Improves Daily Life" and create a presentation. At that time, my computer knowledge was limited to playing games and chatting online. I never imagined that technology would become my future career path.</p>
        
        <p>I was assigned to work with three classmates: Ming, a math genius; Hua, who had excellent writing skills; and Mei, who was always full of creative ideas. Initially, none of us knew where to start. Ming suggested researching artificial intelligence, Hua wanted to explore the impact of social media, and Mei was interested in virtual reality. I felt completely out of my depth and could only listen quietly as they discussed various topics.</p>
        
        <p>The turning point came during our second group meeting. Ming complained that all the materials he found were too technical for ordinary people to understand. Hua also mentioned that her writing was too abstract and lacked concrete examples. That's when I suddenly had an idea: "Why don't we actually create a simple program to demonstrate our concepts?" This suggestion made everyone's eyes light up.</p>
        
        <p>Although I had never written code before, I began frantically learning online. Starting with basic HTML, then moving to JavaScript and CSS, I spent every evening after school studying until late at night. Ming helped me understand algorithmic logic, Hua assisted in translating technical terms into language that ordinary people could understand, and Mei provided many creative user interface ideas.</p>
        
        <p>After three weeks of intensive effort, we developed a simple but fully functional "Smart Home Management System" web application. Users could control simulated operations of lights, air conditioning, speakers, and other home appliances through the webpage. Although it was just a prototype, it successfully demonstrated how Internet of Things technology could make life more convenient.</p>
        
        <p>On presentation day, our demonstration amazed the entire class. Not only were our classmates impressed with our work, but Mr. Wang also praised it highly and gave us the highest grade in the class. More importantly, the principal happened to pass by our classroom, saw our demonstration, and immediately invited us to participate in the school's science fair competition.</p>
        
        <p>During the preparation for the science fair, I discovered that my passion for programming was growing stronger every day. Every time I solved a programming bug or successfully implemented a new feature, I experienced a sense of accomplishment I had never felt before. I began to understand that programming wasn't just about writing code; it was a way to solve problems and create value.</p>
        
        <p>We ultimately won second place in the science fair. Although we didn't take first prize, this experience completely changed my future plans. I began seriously considering computer science as my college major. My family was initially concerned, but when they saw my enthusiasm and talent for programming, they started supporting my decision.</p>
        
        <p>When applying to universities, I described this team collaboration experience in detail in my personal statement, explaining how it inspired me to choose computer engineering. During interviews, professors were impressed that I could self-teach programming and complete an actual project in such a short time. Eventually, I was successfully admitted to my dream computer science program.</p>
        
        <p>Looking back now, that seemingly ordinary high school team project was actually the turning point of my life. It not only helped me discover my interests and talents but also taught me the value of teamwork, the importance of continuous learning, and the courage to try new things. These experiences continue to play an important role in my CS studies today.</p>
